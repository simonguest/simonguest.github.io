As you may have discovered, both want to manipulate the <span class="caps">URL</span>/routes and DOM such that it’s very easily to get them in conflict.  Having been through this recently, I wanted to share some recommendations to get them working&nbsp;together.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Many large organizations have existing VPNs in place, and the rise in development of enterprise mobile applications often requires that apps running outside the firewall need to “<span class="caps">VPN</span> in” before they are allowed to access any corporate&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>While enabling a <span class="caps">VPN</span> is fairly easy on most mobile devices, I’ve found that many IT organizations would like to automate this such that the device automatically connects to the VPN when the Enterprise App or an internal Website is launched. Having gone through this with a couple of customers, I’ve put this post together to highlight how this can be&nbsp;done.</p>

The “out of the box” experience, even with SharePoint 2010, is very basic and doesn’t take advantage of the device. Solutions on the AppStore are a step in the right direction, but many don’t do anything over providing the ability to browse a SharePoint site.

My premise is that the market has become flooded with MEAPs (Mobile Enterprise Application Platforms, as coined by Gartner), yet most of them are fundamentally taking organizations and developers down the wrong path when it comes to developing mobile applications.  The problem is that MEAPs demo really well in front of the CIO… “Wow!  You just hit F5, and your application is compiled and deployed to iOS, Android, Blackberry devices…  Where do I sign?” – yet the reality is very&nbsp;different.</p>

At Neudesic, the partner behind developing the both toolkits for iOS and Android, we’ve been working with customers that use the toolkit to connect mobile applications to the cloud. One of the recent requests however has been to provide a walkthrough of getting started with the toolkit. The current build on <a href="http://github.com/microsoft-dpe">GitHub</a> was released for a specific version of Eclipse and the Android tools, and as a result, can be a little challenging getting the library and sample code up and running. In this post, I’ll explain what it takes to download the toolkit, create a brand new environment in Eclipse, and get started quickly with the&nbsp;toolkit.</p>
