<p>Spending a couple of hours over labor day last month, I set myself a task of building a “Flag Matching” application for Windows Phone 7 (<span class="caps">WP7</span>). My goal was twofold: Build a simple application that he can use (and that I can offer on the marketplace), and at the same time, look into some of the TDD best practices for developing a WP7&nbsp;application.</p>

Rather than showing a bunch of marketing slides, I thought it would be more interesting to put together a short tutorial for running Apache Tomcat on Windows Azure.  When I speak with Java developers interested in Windows Azure, this is often the #1 request. Here is an overview of what I will be&nbsp;showing:</p>
