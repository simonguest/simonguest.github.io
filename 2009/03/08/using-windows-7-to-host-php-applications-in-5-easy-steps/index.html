          <section class="content"><p>A few people have asked me recently whether it’s possible to setup Windows 7 as a <span class="caps">PHP</span> server (for development purposes).  The answer is absolutely yes, and it’s a breeze to setup.  Follow these five simple steps to get PHP up and running in&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>Programs and Features </strong>control panel, click on the <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong>&nbsp;link:</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the list of Windows Features, expand<strong> Internet Information Services</strong>, <strong>World Wide Web Services</strong>, and the <strong>Application Deployment Features</strong>.  If it’s not already, select the <strong><span class="caps">CGI</span></strong> checkbox and click <span class="caps">OK</span>.  (The most reliable way of hosting PHP applications on Windows 7 is to use the built in FastCGI interface for IIS – checking this box installs it together with any&nbsp;pre-requisites.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Download the <strong>non-thread-safe</strong> <strong>(<span class="caps">NTS</span>) </strong>version of <span class="caps">PHP</span> from <a href="http://www.php.net/downloads.php">http://www.php.net/downloads.php</a>.  The current version (as of time of writing is 5.2.9).  (The thread safe (<span class="caps">TS</span>) version will also work, but generally NTS is faster, and thread safety is not an issue under FastCGI).  Expand the zip to an installation directory of your choice – e.g.&nbsp;c:devphp</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copy the <strong>php.ini-recommended </strong>file to <strong>php.ini </strong>in the <span class="caps">PHP</span> directory.  Edit the php.ini file and add correctly configure <strong>extension_dir</strong>, pointing to the <span class="caps">PHP</span> extensions directory (normally the .ext folder of the PHP installation – e.g c:devphpext).  You can also configure other php.ini options and modules here if&nbsp;required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run <strong>Internet Information Services Manager</strong> by typing <strong>inetmgr</strong> in the Start menu.  You can either set the global settings of the server, or (recommended) add a new web site to run the <span class="caps">PHP</span> applications.  Once you’ve done this, double click on the <strong>Handler Mappings </strong>for the site and add a new module mapping with the following&nbsp;settings:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Request path </strong>should be set to <em>.php.  <strong>Module</strong> should be FastCgiModule.  <strong>Executable</strong> should be {php_install_dir}php-cgi.exe.  <em>*Name</em></em> can be anything – I use “<span class="caps">PHP</span> via Fast&nbsp;CGI”.</p>
<p>That’s it! Simply start/restart <span class="caps">IIS</span> and you are ready to go.  The easiest way to test that everything is working is to create a simple info.php file with a single&nbsp;line:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><span class="php"><span class="preprocessor">&lt;?php</span> phpinfo(); <span class="preprocessor">?&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>When you access this page from a browser (e.g. <a href="http://localhost:8081/info.php">http://localhost:8081/info.php</a>), you should see the <span class="caps">PHP</span> info&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>Validate that the server <span class="caps">API</span> is using CGI/FastCGI and that the loaded configuration file is the one in your installation&nbsp;directory.</p>
