          <section class="content"><p>No code is perfect, but the nasty types of bugs are the ones that happen randomly and infrequently.  On a couple of recent Android projects we&#39;ve been experiencing such bugs, and as you can guess they can be difficult to track them&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>While Android&#39;s logcat can help, using the tool often means that you need the device connected through <span class="caps">ADB</span> and a USB cable in order to track the events.  While this is useful in development, this doesn&#39;t work so well when debugging applications that are running on devices in the&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>Rather than setting up your own logging application or service, it&#39;s possible to setup logcat to persistently log to a file on the device or <span class="caps">SD</span> card.  To do this, simply open an ADB Shell and run logcat as a background process with the -f&nbsp;option:</p>
<p>`</p>
<p>adb&nbsp;shell</p>
<h1 id="logcat-f-x2f-mnt-x2f-sdcard-x2f-extsd-x2f-logcat-txt-amp-amp-">logcat -f &#x2F;mnt&#x2F;sdcard&#x2F;extsd&#x2F;logcat.txt&nbsp;&amp;amp;</h1>
<p>`</p>
<p>As you can see in the above statement, this will create a new logcat process to persistently log every event to a file called logcat.txt on the <span class="caps">SD</span> card.  To kill logcat, simply find the PID through the ps tool, and kill the&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>In case you are worried about the size of the log files, logcat also has the ability to do log&nbsp;recycling:</p>
<p>`</p>
<p>adb&nbsp;shell</p>
<h1 id="logcat-r-1024-n-10-f-x2f-mnt-x2f-sdcard-x2f-extsd-x2f-logcat-txt-amp-amp-">logcat -r 1024 -n 10 -f &#x2F;mnt&#x2F;sdcard&#x2F;extsd&#x2F;logcat.txt&nbsp;&amp;amp;</h1>
<p>`</p>
<p>This command will create up to 10 logcat.txt files on the <span class="caps">SD</span> card (named logcat.txt.1, logcat.txt.2, logcat.txt.3, etc.) up to 1Mb in size.  Once the end of the 10<span class="ord">th</span> file is reached, it will overwrite the&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>Finally, this is all great - but if the user reboots the device, the logcat process will be terminated.  To overcome this, simply edit the &#x2F;init.rc file and add the&nbsp;following:</p>
<p>`</p>
<p>service logcat -r 1024 -n 10 -f&nbsp;&#x2F;mnt&#x2F;sdcard&#x2F;extsd&#x2F;logcat.txt</p>

<p>Hope this helps, and happy&nbsp;logging!</p>
