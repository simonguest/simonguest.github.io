          <section class="content"><p>No code is perfect, but the nasty types of bugs are the ones that happen randomly and infrequently.  On a couple of recent Android projects we’ve been experiencing such bugs, and as you can guess they can be difficult to track them&nbsp;down.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>While Android’s logcat can help, using the tool often means that you need the device connected through <span class="caps">ADB</span> and a USB cable in order to track the events.  While this is useful in development, this doesn’t work so well when debugging applications that are running on devices in the&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>Rather than setting up your own logging application or service, it’s possible to setup logcat to persistently log to a file on the device or <span class="caps">SD</span> card.  To do this, simply open an ADB Shell and run logcat as a background process with the -f&nbsp;option:</p>
<pre><code>adb shell
# logcat -f /mnt/sdcard/extsd/logcat.txt <span class="amp">&amp;</span>
</code></pre><p>As you can see in the above statement, this will create a new logcat process to persistently log every event to a file called logcat.txt on the <span class="caps">SD</span> card.  To kill logcat, simply find the PID through the ps tool, and kill the&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>In case you are worried about the size of the log files, logcat also has the ability to do log&nbsp;recycling:</p>
<pre><code>adb shell
# logcat -r 1024 -n 10 -f /mnt/sdcard/extsd/logcat.txt <span class="amp">&amp;</span>
</code></pre><p>This command will create up to 10 logcat.txt files on the <span class="caps">SD</span> card (named logcat.txt.1, logcat.txt.2, logcat.txt.3, etc.) up to 1Mb in size.  Once the end of the 10<span class="ord">th</span> file is reached, it will overwrite the&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>Finally, this is all great - but if the user reboots the device, the logcat process will be terminated.  To overcome this, simply edit the /init.rc file and add the&nbsp;following:</p>
<pre><code>service logcat -r 1024 -n 10 -f /mnt/sdcard/extsd/logcat.txt
    oneshot
</code></pre><p>Hope this helps, and happy&nbsp;logging!</p>
