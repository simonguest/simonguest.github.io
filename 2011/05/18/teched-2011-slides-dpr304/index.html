          <section class="content"><p>Thanks to everyone that came to my session at TechEd 2011 yesterday - it was a great crowd, and the presentation was a lot of fun to put together. My apologies for any confusion with the title (i.e. not making it explicit that it was a developer talk in the title) - this will definitely be something that we address next&nbsp;time. </p>
<p>You can find the slides from the talk below, and the source code of all demos can be found on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simonguest">GitHub</a>. Hope you enjoy, and look forward to any&nbsp;feedback.</p>
<p><strong><em> Update - corrected Session code in&nbsp;title </em></strong></p>
