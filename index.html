One of the symptoms of this has been the bluetooth preferences pane showing “do not localize” when things become&nbsp;corrupt.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>The process of creating automated tests for Web applications has been around for many years. Vendors such as <span class="caps">HP</span>, Parasoft, QFS, and even Microsoft have test software that can be used to create and run automated tests. Over the past couple of years however, we’ve seen an industry-trend towards open source Web testing solutions based on JavaScript. Such solutions have the advantage of being easily modified, free to download, very modular, supported by a vibrant community, and (given the popularity of client-side JavaScript) tests can often be written using the same language as the Web&nbsp;application. </p>

While I could have used the Basic Imaging Profile (<span class="caps">BIP</span>) of the Bluetooth 4.0 specification, this particular application has specific requirements that would have been difficult to implement using BIP.  To overcome this, I ended up building an application that instead relies on the Serial Port Profile (SPP), exchanging data using the RFCOMM&nbsp;protocol.  </p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>If you’ve undertaken any Android development, you’ll have likely found that the Android emulator can be painfully slow – to the point where the majority of developers I know use a physical device to do any development at all.  The primary reason behind this is that the default emulator is emulating an <span class="caps">ARM</span> based chipset on x86 hardware, and the translation between these two architectures is of course costly.  What many of these developers may not realize (and I didn’t until very recently) is that Intel have released a x86 Android emulator.  The x86 emulator has a few caveats (and of course cannot run any ARM-only libraries, such as the Google Play APIs), but overall can be used to speed up the performance of testing apps in the emulator by leaps and&nbsp;bounds.</p>
