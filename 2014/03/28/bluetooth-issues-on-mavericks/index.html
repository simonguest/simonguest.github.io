          <section class="content"><p>I’ve been having some issues recently with the Bluetooth stack on my Mac acting strangely - causing Bluetooth devices to drop at random times and on occasions, the default mouse and keyboard will stop working even though the machine is running fine. One of the symptoms of this has been the bluetooth preferences pane showing “do not localize” when things become&nbsp;corrupt.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>I think (well, I hope) I’ve solved it by performing an <span class="caps">SMC</span> and NVRAM reset on the Mac. In case other are seeing similar symptoms, I wanted to share how you do these&nbsp;resets:</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">SMC</span> Reset:</strong> Power down the Mac. Hold down Shift-Control-Option and the power button for a few seconds. Not much will happen. Release all of the keys, and power on&nbsp;normally.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NVRAM</span> Reset:</strong> Power down the Mac. Hold Command, P and R down and power on the Mac. The Mac will boot for a few seconds and then reboot. Release all of the keys at this point, and boot&nbsp;normally.</p>
<p>After doing these resets, the Bluetooth stack seems a lot more&nbsp;stable.</p>
